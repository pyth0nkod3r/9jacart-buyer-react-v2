example.com's Cancellation and Refund Policy is crafted to embody global best practices,
drawing from frameworks like the EU Consumer Rights Directive and your region's FCCPC
guidelines, ensuring maximum flexibility, transparency, and protection for customers. This
policy integrates BNPL features to allow cancellations without financial penalties where
possible, promoting trust and accessibility for all users, including those in the diaspora.

<div className="space-y-4">
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Pre-Shipping Cancellations</h3>
<p>
Orders can be canceled free of charge at any time before shipping (within 30 minutes of
placement). For BNPL orders, this results in immediate loan cancellation with no impact
on your credit profile.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Post-Shipping Cancellations</h3>
<p className="mb-2">
Cancellation of orders of non-perishable goods are subject to the policy of the vendor. If
an order has shipped but not yet delivered, cancellations are subject to the policy of the
vendor provided the goods are non-perishable. Once delivered, cancellations transition
to our Return Policy (see Shipping and Return Policy).
</p>
<p className="font-medium text-foreground">NOTE: Perishable goods are non-refundable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Service Cancellations</h3>
<p className="mb-2">
For services (e.g., travel, laundry, ride-hailing), cancellations follow provider-specific windows:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
<li><strong>Travel & Tours:</strong> Cancellations are subject to the policy of the service provider.</li>
<li><strong>Ride-Hailing (Uber/Bolt):</strong> Refund upon cancellation is subject to the policy of the service provider.</li>
<li><strong>Laundry:</strong> Cancellations are free for up to 2 hours after booking. No refund during/post execution of services. Cancellations are subject to the policy of the service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p className="mt-2">
All cancellations are initiated via the dashboard, with instant confirmations.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Automatic Cancellations</h3>
<p>
We reserve the right to cancel orders due to stock unavailability, pricing errors, or
suspected fraud, with full refunds and alternative offers provided where necessary.

<div className="space-y-4">
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Refund Eligibility</h3>
<p>
Refunds are available for cancellations, returns, overpayments, or defective/unfulfilled
services. Full refunds include the purchase price, shipping fees (if applicable), and any
transaction fees paid.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Refund Process</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
<li>Initiate via dashboard or support channels.</li>
<li>Processing time: 7 business days for bank transfers.</li>
<li>For BNPL: Refunds apply first to outstanding installments, reducing or eliminating future payments. Overpaid amounts are refunded to your linked account.</li>
<li>Partial refunds (e.g., for bundled orders) are calculated proportionally.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Refund Methods</h3>
<p>
Refunds are issued to the original payment method (PayStack). Refunds are issued by the
vendors or service provider.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Timelines and Exceptions</h3>
<p>
Refunds for defective items are prioritized within 48 hours. No refunds for used/non-returnable
items unless faulty. In cases of force majeure (e.g., natural disasters), refunds may be delayed
but communicated promptly.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Dispute-Related Refunds</h3>
<p>
If a dispute (see Dispute Policy) results in a favorable outcome, refunds are expedited with
potential compensation for inconvenience (e.g., 10% bonus credit).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We track refund satisfaction and aim for 100% resolution within stipulated timelines. Abuse
of this policy may lead to restrictions.
