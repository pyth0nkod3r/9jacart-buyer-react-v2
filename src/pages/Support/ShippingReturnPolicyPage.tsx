<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Delivery Options and Timelines</h3>
<p className="mb-2">
We partner with a reputable logistics provider â United Parcel Services (UPS) â and local
couriers to ensure fast and reliable delivery across your region and to select international
destinations for diaspora customers. Delivery timelines are:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
<li><strong>Local delivery:</strong> 1â3 business days from the date of receipt of product from vendor.</li>
<li><strong>Other major cities</strong> (e.g., Abuja, Port Harcourt): 2â7 business days for non-perishable products and 48 hours for perishable goods from the date of delivery of goods by vendor.</li>
<li><strong>Remote areas in your region:</strong> 7â14 business days from the date of delivery of goods by vendor.</li>
<li><strong>Diaspora shipments</strong> (e.g., to the UK, US, or Canada): 7â21 business days, subject to customs clearance.</li>
</ul>
<p className="mt-2">
Estimated delivery dates are provided at checkout and via email/SMS notifications.
Real-time tracking is available through our user dashboard and app.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Order Processing</h3>
<p>
Orders are processed within 24 hours subject to vendor's confirmation.
For BNPL purchases, shipping commences only after credit approval, which typically occurs
instantly or within 1 hour. If delays occur due to stock verification or high demand, customers
are notified immediately, and alternative options (e.g., similar products) are offered without charge.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Shipping Costs and Customs</h3>
<p>
All shipping fees are clearly displayed at checkout. For diaspora orders, customers are responsible
for any applicable customs duties, taxes, or import fees, which are estimated upfront. We provide
documentation assistance to facilitate smooth customs processing.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Damaged or Incorrect Items</h3>
<p>
Upon delivery, customers must inspect items immediately. If an item arrives damaged, defective,
or incorrect, notify us within 48 hours via our app, email or telephone line.

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Return Guidelines</h2>
<div className="space-y-4">
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Return Eligibility</h3>
<p className="mb-2">
Returns are accepted for most items within 30 days of delivery (exceeding the standard 14â15 days
in many global policies), provided the item is unused, in original packaging, and with all
tags/accessories intact. Exceptions include:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
<li>Perishable goods (e.g., groceries), personalized items, intimate apparel, or digital downloads, which are non-returnable unless defective.</li>
<li>Services (e.g., laundry, travel bookings, Uber/Bolt rides) are returnable only if unfulfilled or defective, subject to provider terms.</li>
</ul>
<p className="mt-2">
Eligible returns must be initiated through the user dashboard for a Return Merchandise
Authorization (RMA) number.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Return Process</h3>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
<li>Log into your account and select "Return Item" within the 30-day window.</li>
<li>Provide reasons and photos if applicable (e.g., for defects).</li>
<li>Once received and inspected (typically within 14 business days), we process the return.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Integration with BNPL</h3>
<p>
For BNPL purchases, returns trigger an automatic adjustment to your payment plan. Full returns
result in a complete reversal of the loan balance, with any paid installments refunded to your
original payment method or credited toward future purchases. Partial returns adjust the
outstanding balance proportionally. Payments are paused during the return process to avoid undue charges.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Refunds for Returns</h3>
<p>
Refunds are issued within 7 business days of vendor's confirmation via the original payment method.
No restocking fees apply unless the return is due to customer error (e.g., change of mind), in which
case a 15% fee may be deducted.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Warranties and Guarantees</h3>
<p>
All vendors are verified and legitimate. Our approved vendors have undergone thorough profiling
and scrutiny to ascertain the validity and legitimacy of their services.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We continuously monitor and improve our shipping and return processes through customer feedback,
aiming for a 99% on-time delivery rate and resolution satisfaction. Violations of this policy
(e.g., fraudulent returns) may result in account suspension.
